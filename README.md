# Weather App

Creating a weather app using an API. 

## The problem

There has been a lot of problems on the way but most code problems I have managed to solve after a while. My biggest problem was getting it to work with the branches. I used Figma for planning but would do an even more specific and better plan next time. If I had time I would make it available to search for different cities and display the weather for the user.
